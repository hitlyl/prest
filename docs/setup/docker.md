  prestd can be deployed locally or on your private instance using Docker

This guide assumes that you already have Postgres running and helps you set up the _**prestd**_ using Docker and connect it to your Postgres database.

In case you’d like to run _**prestd**_ with a fresh Postgres database, follow this guide to deploy the _**prestd**_ along with a Postgres instance using _Docker Compose_.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
- [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)

Create an installation folder called `prestd` where you would like your `prestd` installation and data storage.

**`cd`** (open/join) into the installation folder.

---

## Quick Start

We will use docker to run pREST and connect to an existing database.
To simplify the example we leave the authentication module off

```shell
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
    -e PREST_PG_URL=postgres://username:password@hostname:port/dbname \
    -e PREST_DEBUG=true \
    prest/prest:v1
```

Edit the `PREST_PG_URL` env var value, so that you can connect to your Postgres instance.

Examples of `PREST_PG_URL`:

- postgres://admin:password@localhost:5432/my-db
- postgres://admin:@localhost:5432/my-db _(if there is no password)_

> If your password contains special characters (e.g. #, %, $, @, etc.), you need to URL encode them in the `PREST_PG_URL` env var (e.g. %40 for @).
> You can check the logs to see if the database credentials are proper and if pREST is able to connect to the database.
> pREST needs access permissions to your Postgres database as described in [permissions page](/prestd/permissions/).

### Network config

If your Postgres instance is running on `localhost`, the following changes will be needed to the `docker run` command to allow the Docker container to access the host’s network.

Add the `--net=host` flag to access the host’s Postgres service.

This is what your command should look like:

```shell
docker run -d --net=host -p 3000:3000 \
    -e PREST_PG_URL=...
```

> if you are using another operating system we recommend reading the [docker network documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/), on **macOS** and **Windows** it is different.

## With Docker Compose

> Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose, see the [list of features](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#features).

##### Download docker compose file

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prest/prest/main/docker-compose-prod.yml -O docker-compose.yml
```

##### Up (run) PostgreSQL and prestd

```sh
docker-compose up
```

##### Run data migration to create user structure for access (JWT)

```sh
docker-compose exec prest prestd migrate up auth
```

##### Create user and password for API access (via JWT)

- **user:** prest
- **pass:** prest

```sh
docker-compose exec postgres psql -d prest -U prest -c "INSERT INTO prest_users (name, username, password) VALUES ('pREST Full Name', 'prest', MD5('prest'))"
```

##### Check if the user was created successfully (by doing a select on the table)

```sh
docker-compose exec postgres psql -d prest -U prest -c "select * from prest_users"
```

## First call on API

Example using `curl`:

```sh
curl -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:3000/databases -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
